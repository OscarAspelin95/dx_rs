# Description
The Rust programming language is really coming along with respect to fullstack development. This project has one goal - investigate the feasibility of using Rust for a fullstack microservices application.


# Stack
[Rust]() as the programming language of choice.
[Dioxus]() fullstack framework.
[SurrealDb]() as database.
[Surrealist]() as the DMS.


# Issues
* Dioxus app still does not run with --web
* Dioxus app still not dockerized (need ngix or similar?).
